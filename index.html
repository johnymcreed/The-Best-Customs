                              <span> Installing can take a while due to the file's size, and how strong your computer's ability to handle it goes, for instances a computer running on i9 will breeze through it, while i4-i5 wont't have the best time. It's best <code>Left Alone</code> if you want it to work first time. <br>  <br> To bring it short and simple grab the file's <code> Custom.zip & Tfcustom.zip </code> and extract them to your desktop. from there drag each one to it's correct place.
                                <br> <br>
